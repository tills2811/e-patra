            <p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of your information when you use the Service and tells you about your privacy rights and how the law protects You.</p>
            <p>We use your personal data to provide and improve the services. By using the Service, You agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>1. Introduction</h5></div>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes the manner in which we, Anisoft LLC. ("Anisoft") & its subsidiary, use and protect your personal information that you provide, or that is otherwise obtained or generated by us, in connection with your usage of our product e-Patra (“the Platform”). For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ refers to e-Patra, an Anisoft Company, and ‘you’ refers to you, the user of the Services.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>1.1 Privacy Principles</h6></div>
            <p>e-Patra has two basic and most important principles when it comes to collecting and processing of your private data:</p>
              <p>(i) We do not use your data to show any ads or do not sell it to a third-party client.</p>
  <p>(ii) We only store the data that e-Patra needs to operate as a safe feature-rich communication service and the content updated/shared by users in their profile.</p>
             
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>1.2. Terms of Service</h6></div>
            <p>This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service, which describes the terms and conditions under which you use our Platform, are available at <a href="https://e-patra.com/terms.html">https://e-patra.com/terms.html</a>. This Privacy Policy should therefore be read in conjunction with those terms.</p> 
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>2. Processing your personal information</h5></div>
            <p>We process your personal information on the basis that such processing is necessary to further our interests, including:<br> 
              <p>(1) providing effective, secure and innovative services to our users; and</p>
           
              <p>(2) to detect or prevent security issues in respect of our provision of services, unless those interests are overpowered by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms that require protections of personal data.</p> 
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h5>3. Account</h5></div>
             <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>3.1. Account Information</h6></div>
           
            <p>e-Patra is a simple email service platform. You provide your email id(used as recovery) and basic account details (which may include username, full name) to create a e-Patra account. We do not want to know your gender, age or what you like. We mainly use your data to:<br></p>
            <p>(i) To provide rich and interactive experience.</p>
        <p>(ii) To update, secure, and troubleshoot, as well as provide support.</p>
<p>(iii) Personalise our products and make recommendations.</p>
<p>(iv) To analyse our performance, to meet our legal obligations, develop our workforce and perform research.</p>
            <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>3.2. Emails</h6></div>
                       
             <p> (i). Encryption:</p>
             <p>Emails in our Platform use end-to-end encryption. This means that all your data is encrypted with a key that only you manage and regenerate if required. The encryption is done in order to protect your data against us and third parties from reading them and to learn what information is being shared in those emails. The key is auto-generated in your profile during signup.</p> <p> (ii). Junk mails and Illegal activities: </p>
             <p>a. Junk mails: Do not use e-Patra to distribute spam or unsolicited commercial mail. Regular spamming of junk emails and complaints against spamming may result in termination of account temporarily or permanently.</p>
             <p>b. Multiple accounts:Do not create or use multiple accounts to violate e-Patra's policies, bypass the account limitations, circumvent filters, or otherwise subvert restrictions placed on your account. (For example, if you have been blocked by another user or have had your e-Patra account disabled due to abuse, do not create a replacement account that engages in similar activity.). Additionally, You are also not allowed to create e-Patra accounts by automated means or buy, sell, trade, or re-sell these accounts to others.</p>
             <p>c. Malware: Do not use e-Patra to transmit viruses, malware, worms, defects, Trojan horses, corrupted files, or any other items of a destructive or deceptive nature. In addition, do not distribute content that harms or interferes with the operation of networks, servers, or other infrastructure belonging to Anisoft or others.</p>
             <p>d. Copyright: Respect copyright laws. Do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, including patent, trademark, trade secret, or other proprietary rights. You are also not allowed to encourage or induce others to violate intellectual property rights.</p>

            <p>If you registered for e-Patra from the UK or the EEA, your data is stored in data centers in the UK. These are third-party provided cloud storage exclusively for e-Patra.

As such, we do not share your personal data with such cloud providers.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>4.2. End-to-End Encrypted Data</h6></div>
            <p>Your content, media and files attached with the mail, are all encrypted with your public/private key. While e-Patra servers will handle this end-to-end encrypted data to deliver it to the recipient – or store it in the database.</p>
              <div class="single-feature mt-15 mb-15"><h6>4.3. Data Retention</h6></div>
